# Why DO You Use The Zip() Method In Python ?

# As an AI language model, I do not use 
# the zip() method. However, I can tell you that the zip()
# method in Python is used to combine two or more iterables (lists, tuples, sets, etc.)
# into a single iterator of tuples. This is useful when you want to iterate over multiple sequences at
# the same time and access corresponding elements in each sequence. The resulting iterator contains tuples
# where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables. The zip() method stops when the shortest input iterable has been exhausted
