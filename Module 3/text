Here's a Python program that reads a random line from a file:

```python
import random

with open("file.txt") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    random_line = random.choice(lines)
    print(random_line.strip())
```

In this program, we first open the file "file.txt" using a `with` statement, which automatically closes the file when we're done with it. We then read all the lines from the file into a list using the `readlines()` method.

Next, we use the `random.choice()` function to select a random line from the list of lines, and we use the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the line.

Finally, we print the randomly selected line to the console.
