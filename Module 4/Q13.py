# How  Many Exceots Statements can a try-except block have ? name some built in exception classes ?
A try-except block can have multiple except statements to handle different types of exceptions. 

Some built-in exception classes in Python are:

1. IndexError - raised when an index is out of range
2. KeyError - raised when a key is not found in a dictionary
3. ValueError - raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value
4. TypeError - raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type
5. ZeroDivisionError - raised when division or modulo by zero is performed
6. FileNotFoundError - raised when a file or directory is not found
7. ImportError - raised when a module, function or variable cannot be found
8. NameError - raised when a variable is not found in local or global scope
9. StopIteration - raised when the next() method of an iterator has no further items.
