# What Is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology ?
# Instantiation in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) terminology refers to the process of creating an instance or object from a class. In other words, instantiation is the process of creating a specific object or instance of a class with its own set of properties and behaviors that are defined by the class. It involves allocating memory for the object and initializing its properties and methods. Once an object is instantiated, it can be used to perform various operations and interact with other objects and classes in the program.
