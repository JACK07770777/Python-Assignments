# # Explain What Does Django-Admin.py Make Messages Command Is Used For ?


# Django-admin.py make messages command is used to create or update message files for translation. It scans the Django project and generates message files for all the translations that are specified in the project.

# The command searches for translation strings specified in the code and creates or updates a .po file with the translation strings. These .po files can then be translated into different languages and compiled into .mo files.

# # Once the translation files are generated and compiled, Django can use them to display translated messages to users. This allows developers to easily create multilingual websites and applications.
